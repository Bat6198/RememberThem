<p style="font-size:22px;"> Guh huh, hi everybody! I'm Clicky the Mouse! I'm here to teach you a few things about the adventure you're going on! </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> This is a point and click adventure. You will want to use me to click on the images to progress! </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> Sometimes there will be many things to click on, sometimes only one thing. It's up to you find them. Whenever I point at something with my pointer finger, that's something you can click! </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> This world makes no sense and is topsy-turvy! Some paths won't make sense and get you all flip turned upside down. </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> Some locations that look identical might actually be different, so stay on the watch! Everything seen here is intentional, so keep that in mind. </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> Please be aware some screens include things such bright colors and fast moving images.  </p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"> Now let's get in there and have some FUN! Click on me to start! </p>
